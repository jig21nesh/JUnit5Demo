#JUnit 5 Demo
    JUnit 5 demo project - configured with JUnit 5 libraries
    Project has a sample class and some simple methods which are to be tested using JUnit 5

## Getting Started
    Project was created 
        IntelliJ 2016.2
        Java 8!!
        
## Prerequisities
    There are a number of artciles and examples are available (most of them are not up to date!). Mainly because JUnit 5 itself is being worked 
    on by the team. At the time of writing this, all sample tests are working fine. (It might not work in future until the final version of JUnit 5)
    released.

    It would be worth to read or glance at pom.xml
